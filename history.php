                <h3>NG MUI</h3>
                <p>
                    Ng Mui was a Buddhist involved with a secret underground Kung Fu society. She was well known for her
                    outstanding fighting ability and her fused style. Although the origin of Ng Mui's style of martial arts
                    is unknown, it is believed she used the both the snake and crane techniques in her unique fighting style.
                    This style,at the time, had no name. She later heard of a woman named Yim Ving Tsun and decided to begin
                    training her very first student.

                <h3>YIM VING TSUN</h3>
                <p>
                    Yim Ving Tsun was a Chinese woman who was betrothed to Leung Bok Choy. She, however, attracted the
                    unwanted attention of a Chinese warlord who wanted her hand in marriage. She refused, and
                    in response, the warlord began to harass and beat Yim Ving Tsun's father and her husband-to-be. Ng Mui
                    stepped in to the picture and told Yim Ving Tsun to challenge the warlord to a challenge match in six
                    months on the premise that she couldn't marry someone she could best in combat. When the warlord heard
                    this offer, he accepted, thinking nothing of this small woman. Yim Ving Tsun trained for six months with Ng
                    Mui. When Yim Ving Tsun returned, she defeated the warlord. He was never seen again. As Ng Mui continued
                    to train Yim Ving Tsun, she realized that she needed to establish officially what she was teaching. She
                    named the art Ving Tsun, which means everlasting spring time or new beginning in honor of Yim Ving Tsun.
                    The second student of this art was Yim Ving Tsun's husband Leung Bok Choy.

                <h3>YIP MAN</h3><br>
                <p>
                    Yip Man was a famous teacher of Ving Tsun who revitalized the system. He was educated in short and long
                    style Ving Tsun which were two different styles taught by the two prominent Ving Tsun teachers at the time. He took their
                    styles and perfected them into one. He also changed the style to adapt to the globalizing world of
                    martial arts. In 1949, when Yip Man moved from mainland China to Hong Kong, he saw a multitude of
                    different styles of martial arts from around the world. In particular, American and British boxers, along
                    with Russian wrestlers, were setting up challenge matches in Hong Kong to prove that their style of
                    martial arts was the best. Time and time again, they were besting the local martial artists who had never
                    trained against these styles. Yip Man adapted Ving Tsun to account for these different styles and he
                    became famous due to his school's undefeated challenge match record and for the fact that Yip Man's
                    school was the only one who could stand up to these foreigners. Yip Man was also known as one of Bruce
                    Lee's prominent teachers, starting his training with Lee in 1957. Despite this recognition, Bruce Lee only
                    trained with Yip Man for a short period of time before going to America in 1959.

                <h3>MOY YAT</h3>
                <p>
                    Moy Yat was known as the "librarian" of the Ving Tsun system. He earned this name because of his
                    construction (with the careful supervision of Yip Man) of the Kuen Kuit which is an inscription of all
                    of the teachings of Ving Tsun on jade rock for preservation. Moy Yat was given this
                    task because he was so well-known for his calligraphy and high level of education. Today, the Kuen
                    Kuit is in possession of Moy Yat's son William Moy. Moy Yat was also the youngest Sifu (teacher) to
                    teach in Yip Man's schools and the first master under Yip Man to bring Ving Tsun to America.

                <h3>MASTER DON GREEN (MOY DON)</h3>
                <p>
                    Master Don Green (Moy Don) started learning Ving Tsun in Virginia under Sifu Duncan Leung and also trained while he
                    was in the United States Navy. This took place when Master Green was 17 years old and continued until he was
                    20. When he returned to Rochester, he began training Ving Tsun under Sifu Moy Yat in New York City. Because
                    of the distance he was traveling each time to train with Moy Yat, he was referred to train with one of
                    Moy Yat's students in Canada: Dunn Wah Tang (Sunny Tang). Once Moy Don finished his training with Sunny
                    Tang, he went back to New York City to finish his training with Moy Yat, soon becoming a certified teacher
                    in the Moy Yat family. Don Green officially became a disciple (Bi Si) under Moy Yat in 1994. At the time,
                    however, Moy Don had already started a school under Sunny Tang in September of 1992 which transitioned to
                    be under the Moy Yat family. This school was eventually relocated to where it is today.
