            <h3>NG MUI</h3>
            <p>
                Ng Mui was a Buddhist involved with secret underground Kung Fu society. She was well known for her
                outstanding fighting ability and her fused style. Although the origin of Ng Mui's style of martial arts
                is unknown it was believed she used the both the snake and crane techniques in her unique fighting style
                which at the time had no name. She later heard of a woman named Yim Ving Tsun and decided to begin
                training her very first student...

            <h3>YIM VING TSUN</h3>
            <p>
                Yim Ving Tsun was a chinese woman who was promised to marry Leung Bok Choy. She however attracted the
                unwanted attention of a chinese war lord who wanted her hand in marriage. She of course refused and so
                in response the war lord began to harass and beat up Yim Ving Tsun's father and husband to be. Ng Mui
                stepped in to the picture and told Yim Ving Tsun to challenge the warlord to a challenge match in 6
                months on the premise that she couldn't marry someone she could best in combat. When the warlord heard
                this offer he accepted thinking nothing of this small woman. Yim Ving Tsun trained for 6 months with Ng
                Mui and when she returned she defeated the warlord who was never to be seen again. As Ng Mui continued
                to train Yim Ving Tsun she realized that she needed to establish officially what she was teaching. She
                named the art Ving Tsun which means everlasting spring time or new beginning in Yim Ving Tsun's honor.
                The second student of this art was Yim Ving Tsun's husband Leung Bok Choy.

            <h3>YIP MAN</h3>
            <p>
                Yip Man was a famous teacher of Ving Tsun who revitalized the system. He was educated in short and long
                style Ving Tsun which were taught by the two prominent Ving Tsun teachers at the time. He took their
                styles and perfected it in to one. He also changed the style to adapt to the globalizing world of
                martial arts. In 1949 when Yip Man moved from mainland China to Hong Kong he saw a multitude of
                different styles of martial arts from around the world. In particular American and British boxers along
                with Russian wrestlers were setting up challenge matches in Hong Kong to prove that their style of
                martial arts was the best. Time and time again they were besting the local martial artists who had never
                trained against these styles. Yip Man adapted Ving Tsun to account for these different styles and he
                became famous due to his school's undefeated challenge match record and for the fact that Yip Man's
                school was the only one who could stand up to these foreigners. Yip Man was also known as one of Bruce
                Lee's prominent teachers starting his training with him in 1957. Despite this recognition Bruce Lee only
                trained with Yip Man for a short period of time before going to America in 1959.

            <h3>MOY YAT</h3>
            <p>
                Moy Yat was known as the "librarian" of the Ving Tsun system. He earned this name because of his
                construction (with the careful supervision of Yip Man) of the Kuen Kuit which was an inscription of all
                of the teachings of Ving Tsun on jade rock in order to preserve these teachings. Moy Yat was given this
                task because he was so well know for his calligraphy and his high level of education. Today the Kuen
                Kuit is in the possession of Moy Yat's son William Moy. Moy Yat was also the youngest Sifu (teacher) to
                teach in Yip Man's schools and the first master under Yip man to bring Ving Tsun to America.

            <h3>MASTER DON GREEN (MOY DON)</h3>
            <p>
                Master Don Green (Moy Don) started Ving Tsun in Virginia under Duncan Leung and also trained while he
                was in the United States Navy. This took place when Master Green 17 years old and continued until he was
                20. When he returned to Rochester NY he began training Ving Tsun from Moy Yat in New York City. Because
                of the distance he was traveling each time to train with Moy Yat he was referred to train with one of
                Moy Yat's students in Canada Dunn Wah Tang (Sunny Tang). Once Moy Don finished his training with Sunny
                Tang he went back to New York City to finish his training with Moy Yat soon becoming a certified teacher
                in the Moy Yat family. Don Green officially became a disciple (Bi Si) under Moy Yat in 1994. At the time
                however Moy Don had already started a school under Sunny Tang in September of 1992 which transitioned to
                be under the Moy Yat family. This school was eventually relocated to the where it is today.
